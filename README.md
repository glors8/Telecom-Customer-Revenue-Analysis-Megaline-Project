# 📊 Megaline Tariff Analysis – Revenue Comparison Project

## 📁 Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world business case for **Megaline**, a telecom company offering two prepaid plans: **Surf** and **Ultimate**.

The goal is to determine **which plan generates more revenue** by analyzing the usage patterns of 500 customers in 2018. This includes data on:

- Calls (duration and count)
- SMS messages sent
- Internet usage
- Customer demographics and plan types

## 🧪 What Was Done

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data types were correct and missing values were addressed.
- **Feature Engineering**: Monthly usage stats per user (calls, texts, MBs) and revenue calculations.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Compared usage behavior between the two plans.
- **Statistical Testing**:
  - Compared average revenue between Surf and Ultimate users.
  - Analyzed regional differences (e.g. NY–NJ vs. other regions).
